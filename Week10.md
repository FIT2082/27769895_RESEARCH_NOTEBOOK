# Week 10

## Meeting
Once again, the main goal of this week's meeting was to demonstrate the current state of the projects and recieve feedback on them. Given that the semester is almost over the main goal is to finish up the project so that they are presentable, as well as begin work on the presentation.
## Development
This week there were a few additional features added to the project, as well as generally cleaning up and improving some of the older parts. The ability to point at objects with the user's left hand was implemented, as well as a method for interacting with those highlighted objects. The user is capable of interacting with the selcted objects by making gestures with the right hand, at the moment lifting the palm up makes a graph appear, whereas facing the palm down causes the graph to disapear. The format of the graphs as well as more variety of data and objects were introduced.

## Next Week
The main goal for next week is to finish off the project so that it can be presented and demonstrate the purpose and functionality of the code. Once this is completed work on the actual presentation can begin. Furthermore, before next week a video demonstrating the program also needs to be created, as well as screenshots of the project.
