# Week 11
## Meeting
As this was the last meeting for the semester, there was a quick demonstration of all of the project completed so far. However, the main focus of the meeting was discussing the evaluation aspect of the project and how to develop a heuristic evaluation for the VR project. A few tips and relevant papers were provided as well as some ideas on how the evaluation could be run. Lastly there was some discussion about the project presentation next week, in particular the poster and how we should approach designing it.

## Development
This week is most likely the last week for any major development of the project. Overall most of the features were cleaned up, so that they were more presentable as well as easier to run an evaluation with. The option to switch between two different modes of interaction was also implemented, one where the user pints with their left hand to select an object, and another where the objects are selected based on the centre of what the user is seeing. Furthermore, the ability to select and change properties of the graph with a palm menu on the left hand is also being added.

## Next Week
The main focus next week will be to finish developing the evaluation and the get feedback on the project using it. Other than this, the poster and two minute pitch will also need to be finalised before friday, when the actual presentation will occur.
