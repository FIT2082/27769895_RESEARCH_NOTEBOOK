# Week 6
## Meeting
During this week's meeting we discussed more of the literatrue that we had looked at in the past week. We also demonstrated some of the work completed over the past week using the leap motion controller. Furthermore, as the meetings take place with another group doing a similar project, we had a look at some of their work importing models into unity, which is relevant and can be used by our project. Lastly, we also got to look at some of the actual data from the plant, this was a great help as it assists in understanding the kind of information that will need to be displayed and interacted with for the project. This data can also be used as sample data for demos of the project as it acts as a solid example of actual potential values.

## Next week
The main goals to complete before next week are furthering the exploration of the leap motion controller, as well as simply gaining a better understanding of integrating it with other technologies. Another one of the tasks is to continue finding more, and categorising, papers into different types, such as visual analytics, VR/AR interaction and even some papers relevant to the context of maintenance work at a plant.
