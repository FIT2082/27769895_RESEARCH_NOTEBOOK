# Week 8
## Meeting
This week we determined a starting point for the development aspect of the project, being a way of querying data from a specific object in VR. Once this is completed work can begin on expanding the concept into a tool in VR or AR that would allow users to hold it over an object and bring up graphs of data and other relevant details. There was also discussion of how to go about the literature review aspect of the final report, which is currently being worked on. Towards the end of the meeting we recieved another tour of, and access to, the VR space which most of the developement for the project will occur in.

## Next week
Throughtout this week a lot of work will be done on actually developing the software aspect of the deliverables, now that new leap motions have arrived and we have access to the VR room. Once the initial steps have been taken in this development we will also start to plan out how to takle the rest of the research with regards to actually creating the VR tool. Other than this, more work will continue to be done on the literature review aspect of the final report.
