# Week 12
## Meeting/Evaluation
Instead of the regular meeting, this week we did the evaluation aspect of the research. There are a few main goals we aimed to get out of the evaluation, to determine which interaction method we developed was more successful, to figure out which parts of the developed product were most successful, and also to discover some more of the key areas that can be improved, or expanded, on in future research of the topic.

## Poster Presentation
This week we finalised the poster as well as the presentation. We also presented the research to the rest of the cohort as well as some of the supervisors. I think this was a great experience, not only being able to see the work completed by everyone else, but also to gain experience in presenting and pitching research, something which will no doubt be a useful skill in future.

## Final Report
The last stage of the research for this semester is to write up the final report. As much of the work for this has already been completed throughout the semester, the majority of the work will be putting it all together.
