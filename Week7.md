# Week 7
## Meeting
Not as much was covered this week as other weeks as not everyone was present and a lot of other assignments were also due this week. However we did brainstorm some ideas of how to focus the project for the remaining weeks. In order to best do this we discussed a lot of the current techniques being used and how the could be either replicated or adapted to suit the purpose of the research. Lastly, we shared and talked about the gathered papers, which was much easier now that they have been categorised. by content.

## Next week
Ideally by next week the other leap motions will have arrived so that more work can be done on the actual coding of the project. Also the inital direction of the project should be decided on so that proper work can begin. Other than that as usual more work will be done on researching relevant papers and writing up summaries or key points of each.
