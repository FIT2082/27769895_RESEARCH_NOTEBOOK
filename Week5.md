# Week 5
## Meeting
The first part of the meeting was spent briefly discussing the project specifications now that that have been completed, and also the different pieces of literatrue that we had looked at. It was useful to discuss the literatrue and the various different things that we can take away from reviewing them, we were also presented with a few more relevant papers to take a look at. A good portion of the meeting was also spent setting up the leap motion controller we were given to use, as well as discussing some of the things that had already been with the leap, or similar technologies. Lastly we talked about the importance of visual analytics within the project as well as taking a look at a few different projects both witth and without AR.

## Next week
Before next week's meeting the main goals are to look into more literatrue, particularly regarding visual analytics, as well as learn to use, and get familiar with, the leap motion controller. Although this is the desktop version and not the AR/VR one, it is still useful to learn from and the skills and work done will directly translate into developing for AR/VR when that aspect of the project starts.
