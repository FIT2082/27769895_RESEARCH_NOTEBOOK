# Week 4
## meeting
This weeks meeting was focused on reviewing and giving feedback on the draft of the project specifications.

## Project specifications
The majority of this week was taken up by the project specifications as they were due this week. However, in doing this a lot of planning was done for the project timeline in particular, as well as looking into potential tools that could be used and reading their relevant literatrue. Researching the previous work realted to the topic was extrememly useful, not only acting as a solid starting point to work from, but also providing many useful ideas which will assist in guiding the direction of the project.

## Next week
Now that the project specifications are finished, actual work on the interaction methods and learning to use leap motion should begin. While working on this we will also continue to review the relevant previous research papers.
