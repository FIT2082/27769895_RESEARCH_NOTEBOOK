# Week 3
## meeting
For this week's meeting we joined another group working on a similar topic, navigation in virtual reality. Having the joint group meeting was helpful as we shared the same end goal of assisting workers with maintenance tasks, and making their jobs easier. A lot of the meeting was spent discussing how to best write the research proposal, as well details on the various relevant technologies that should be mentioned. We also briefly went through a few papers regarding previous work done on similar topics which could be useful.

## Next week
Before the next meeting I will continue to learn the fundamentals of unity, with a particular focus on importing objects as well as some of the basics of working with AR and VR. Ideally a solid draft of the research proposal will be completed before the next meeting, so that it can be finalised by the end of next week.
